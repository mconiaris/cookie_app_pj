class UsersController < ApplicationController

  # 1. the first thing we do is ensure that the browser that made
  #   the request is authenticated as someone in our database
  # 2. we do this by checking an authenticate method defined for
  #   every controller in ApplicationController
  # 3. because we are putting all user actions except sign up
  #   and new user creation (you can't be authenticated if
  #   you're not) on the site yet, we'll authenticate all except
  #   those...
  #
  before_action :authenticate, except: [:new, :create]

  # 1. the next thing we do is load the current resource, which in
  #   this case is user -- thus, "load_user"...
  # 2. the load_user method is in this class because it references
  #   the current resource -- it won't be a universal need for
  #   authentication and authorization!
  # 3. we need to load the user on the "member routes", ie
  #   routes with an "/:id", which are (from rake routes)
  #   edit, show, update and destroy...
  #
  before_action :load_user, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  # 1. finally, we ensure that the authenticated user has the right
  #   to access the loaded resource
  # 2. this is VERY dependent on the logic of our routes and
  #   resources, and so is defined within this controller!
  # 3. anyone has the right to access the new and create routes,
  #   and only admins (in cookie CRUD world, patissieres) can
  #   access the index page (all users), otherwise (edit, show,
  #   update and destroy) if the authenticated user IS the same as
  #   the loaded resource user they can see the page AND admins
  #   can see the page too...
